![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6cb4682-741e-4e03-bd2a-b7f9289badaa)

The goal of this project is to deepen our knowledge in databases and full stack development in a fun way. To do this we made a web Gui that allows users to easily modify a movie database.

### Built With
- HTML
- PHP
- MySQL
- Apache

## Installation 
We created the movie, person, and role tables in sql manually which will have to be replicated by the user. This could be improved this the future by making a seperate file that when ran creates the tables for the user. To use you will need apache for the server php for communication from the front end html to the sql data base. xxamp is optional but is good for packaging the stack.

## Ussage
These buttons are the different functions of our site
